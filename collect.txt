&6We have a extra world (Frontier) where you can collect items.
&6Instead of destroying the main world you need to go to the Frontier.
&6Inside the Frontier you can't break most ores though.
&6To mine you can go to Euphoria the main world.
&6But if you just want stone go to Frontier.
&6Also chopping down trees is something you do in the Frontier.
&6If you decide to chop down trees in main world you need to replant them.
&6But you can see that also in the environment rules.

&6There are many portals in the Frontier that you can use.
&6The frontier world will reset pretty often so you can easy get items.
&6Some professions can only be done in the Frontier.

&6To get to the frontier use the portal in the main spawn.
&6Just take the bridge to the other side of the train station.
