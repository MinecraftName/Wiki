&6Shout is probably the chat you will use most.
&6You shout your chat if you want everyone to read it.
&6There is no command for shouting.
&6Instead you need to add a ! symbol before your text.

&6Example: &8!Anyone wanna join my faction?

&6If you don't use the ! symbol before your text
&6Then you will talk local.
&6See &5/fw clocal &6for more info.
