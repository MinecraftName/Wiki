&6OOC means Out-Of-Character chat.
&6This means when you toggle this chat on you can talk about
&6Things not related to the server and not roleplaying.
&6This chat is a toggle instead of using a command.
&6You can just toggle it on and you can keep sending msges in it.
&6To toggle OOC chat use &5/ooc &6And then you can chat in it.
&6Use the same command to toggle it off again.

&6Example: &8/ooc &7(toggle on)
