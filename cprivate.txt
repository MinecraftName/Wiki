&6Private is to talk player vs player.
&6Others can not read what you tell to the other person.
&6This can be useful to talk about things others may bot hear.
&6To sent private messages you use &5/msg {name} {msg}
&6When you receive a message you can reply to it with &5/r {msg}

&6Example: &8/msg worstboy32 Can you come help me?
&6worst: &8/r Please make a ticket. /modreq {question}
