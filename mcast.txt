&6When you use spells we call it casting spells.
&6To cast a spell you can use different items.
&6Most spells are in the Book, BlazeRod & GoldenSword.

&5Books: &6Mostly got spells for your self like buffs etc.
&5BlazeRod: &6Mostly got spells for long range casting.
&6GoldenSword: &6Mostly got spells for short range combat.

&6But some spells use other items or some even none.
&6Casting spells is almost always by left clicking.
&6You almost always have more then 1 spell learned.
&6This means you need to select a spell to cast.
&6Right click the item to cycle through different spells.
&6And when it says you selected: â€¦ then you can left click.
