&6Magic is something very special and amazing on the server.
6You can learn different magic spells and use them.
&6When you first start you have only basic spells.
&6To learn spells you need to go to the library.
&6Some spells in the library are locked till you earn them.
&6Like for some spells you need to do Quests.
&6Each spell that you learn in the library is yours.
&6You won't unlearn it until you lose a rank or something.

&6There are 50+ spells on the server.
&6We will add more and more from time to time.
