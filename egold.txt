&6As you read in the intro gold on the server is your money.
&6This means if you don't have gold in your inventory 
&6the server thinks you have no money.
&6This is more realistic and makes it harder to manage it.
&6Since there is no place where your money is save unless.. 
&6you place it in one of the Banks but that cost you money.
