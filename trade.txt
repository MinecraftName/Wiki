&6Normally it's really easy to scam players with trading.
&6But we have added a trading system so you can trade fair.
&6Just sneak and right click a player to sent a trade request.
&6When you sent a trade request the other need to do the same.
&6This will open a trading GUI where you can put items in.
&6The left side is yours. And the right side is from the other.
&6There is a Green and a Red wool/button that you can use.
&6When you hit the &cred &6one the trade will be stopped.
&6Hit the &agreen &6one to accept the trade with the other.

&6First sneak and right click another player to open the gui.
&6Then both place items in the gui.
&6And then click both on the green wool.

&aTIP: &6Since gold is money you can easy trade with money.
&aTIP: &6Since you can bottle up exp you can also use exp.
