&57) &6Only start big wars if you have 
&6permissions from the Empire/War leaders!
&7You're not allowed to randomly have a big war.
&7You can have small fights and raids but not big wars.
&7This means you can't randomly attack a main Faction.
&7Ask the War or Empire leaders of your empire so they can start.

&58) &6After you take over another faction 
&6you may loot it but not grief it!
&7When you already have taken over a town you can take resources.
&7But taking it down and griefing it is not allowed.
&7Then we will take back all loot and help the raided faction.
&7Everything you do is logged and if a faction breaks this rule 
&7multiple times they get disbanded!
